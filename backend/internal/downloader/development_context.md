# Downloader Package — Development Context

## Overview

The `downloader` package integrates multiple download tools (SpotiFLAC, yt-dlp, spotDL) to fetch audio files from Spotify URLs and free-text search queries. It manages job lifecycle, concurrency, logging, and database persistence.

## Architecture

- **`API`** — Main struct holding config, DB connection, job map, and semaphore for concurrency control.
- **`Job`** — Represents a download task with status, log, timing, and tool tracking.
- **`Config`** — Holds binary paths, output directory, format settings, and API keys.

### Download Flow

1. **Spotify URL** → `run()` → SpotiFLAC (primary) → yt-dlp (fallback) → spotDL (last resort)
2. **Search query** → `runSearch()` → yt-dlp (with optional DeepSeek query parsing)

### Concurrency

A semaphore (`a.sema`) limits concurrent downloads. Jobs are tracked in-memory and persisted to SQLite.

## Phase 1: Post-Download File Validation & Auto-Retry

### Problem

~12% of files downloaded by yt-dlp won't play because yt-dlp's ffmpeg post-processor fails silently, leaving files with wrong content/extension. The `isValidAudioFile()` function existed but was never called. `validateOutput()` was a no-op.

### Changes Made

#### New Functions

- **`verifyDownloadedFile(path string) error`** — Validates a downloaded file by:
  - Checking file exists and is ≥ 10KB
  - Running ffprobe to verify an audio stream is present (if `FfprobeBin` is configured)

- **`findDownloadedFile(before time.Time) string`** — Searches the output directory for recently created audio files (modified within a 5-minute window around the job start time). Returns the most recently modified matching file.

#### Modified Functions

- **`validateOutput(job *Job) string`** — Replaced no-op with actual validation logic. Calls `findDownloadedFile` + `verifyDownloadedFile`. Returns an error string (empty string = valid).

- **`runSearch()`** — After yt-dlp succeeds, validates the downloaded file. If invalid:
  1. Logs the validation failure
  2. Retries with `ytsearch2:` (second YouTube result) and `m4a` format (avoids ffmpeg conversion)
  3. Validates the retry file
  4. Fails the job if retry also produces an invalid file

- **`run()` (Tier 2 yt-dlp fallback)** — Same validation + retry pattern integrated into the `fallbackErr == nil` block.

### Retry Strategy

- Uses `ytsearch2:` to get the second YouTube result (different from the first attempt)
- Uses `m4a` format to avoid ffmpeg post-processing (which is the root cause of corruption)
- Includes `--postprocessor-args "ffmpeg:-abort_on_error 1 -v warning"` for hard failures
- Uses `--extractor-args "youtube:player_client=android"` for reliability

### Configuration

- `FfprobeBin` field in `Config` — path to ffprobe binary. Auto-detected from `FfmpegBin` if empty. Validation is skipped if not set (graceful degradation).

## File Locations

- Main file: `backend/internal/downloader/downloader.go` (1188 LOC)
- Key line ranges:
  - `verifyDownloadedFile`: ~line 986
  - `findDownloadedFile`: ~line 1016
  - `validateOutput`: ~line 1050
  - `runSearch` validation + retry block: ~line 882
  - `run` Tier 2 validation + retry block: ~line 673
  - `run` Tier 3 validation block: ~line 791

## Phase 2: Hardened yt-dlp Flags

Added to both `run()` and `runSearch()` yt-dlp argument lists:
- `--abort-on-error` — Fail fast on download errors
- `--retries 3 --fragment-retries 10` — Resilience against network issues
- `--postprocessor-args "ffmpeg:-abort_on_error 1 -v warning"` — Make ffmpeg failures fatal
- `--extractor-args "youtube:player_client=android"` — More reliable YouTube access

## Phase 3: Player Auto-Skip (Frontend)

In `frontend/src/player/PlayerContext.tsx`:
- `onError` handler auto-skips to next track after 1.5s delay
- `loadAndPlay()` catch handler also auto-skips
- `consecutiveErrorsRef` tracks consecutive failures (max 5) to prevent infinite loops
- Counter resets on successful playback

## Phase 4: Scanner Size Validation

In `backend/internal/scanner/scanner.go`:
- `indexFile()` skips files < 10KB (logged as suspicious)
- Catches corrupt files already in the library from before the fix

## Phase 5: External Job API (v2.10.0)

The `Job` struct gained a `Kind` field (`"music"` or `"podcast"`) and three new public methods on `*API` let other packages (notably `podcaster`) participate in the unified job system:

- `RegisterExternalJob(kind, url, output, tool string) string` — creates a new job in `running` state, persists to `download_jobs`, returns the generated job ID
- `AppendExternalLog(id, line string)` — appends a line to the in-memory log of an external job
- `FinishExternalJob(id string, status Status, errMsg string)` — finalizes an external job (succeeded/failed) and writes the final state to the DB

These methods don't acquire the concurrency semaphore or trigger rescan — the external caller handles those. The DB schema gained a `kind TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'music'` column with idempotent migration.
