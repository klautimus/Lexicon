# Lexicon

A Plex-like media center for **podcasts and music**, with an LLM (DeepSeek) that watches your listening habits, finds trends, and recommends what to listen to next and automatically downloads music to your local music library for offline use.

- **Backend:** Go + chi + SQLite (FTS5) — single binary, zero-config
- **Frontend:** React + Vite + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + Recharts + lucide-react
- **LLM:** DeepSeek (model `deepseek-v4-flash`, thinking effort `medium`)

## Quick start

### Prerequisites
- **Go 1.22+** — install from <https://go.dev/dl/>. Verify with `go version`.
- **Node 20+** — install from <https://nodejs.org>. Verify with `node -v`.

### 1. Backend

```powershell
cd C:\Users\kevin\CascadeProjects\lexicon\backend
# Edit .env — set MEDIA_ROOTS to your music/podcast folders (semicolon-separated on Windows)
# DEEPSEEK_API_KEY is already filled in for you.
go mod tidy
go run ./cmd/server
```

Backend listens on `http://localhost:8787`. Initial scan runs in the background; watch the log for `[scanner] initial scan complete`.

### 2. Frontend

```powershell
cd C:\Users\kevin\CascadeProjects\lexicon\frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:5173>. The Vite dev server proxies `/api` to the Go backend.

## Configuration (`backend/.env`)

```env
PORT=8787
DB_PATH=./data/lexicon.db
# Multiple roots separated by ';' on Windows, ':' or ';' elsewhere
MEDIA_ROOTS=C:/Users/kevin/Music;D:/Podcasts

DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-...
DEEPSEEK_MODEL=deepseek-v4-flash
DEEPSEEK_THINKING=medium
DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL=https://api.deepseek.com
```

## How it works

### Scanner
Walks `MEDIA_ROOTS` recursively, extracts ID3/FLAC/MP4 metadata via `dhowden/tag`, and upserts tracks into SQLite. Files whose `mtime` matches the DB row are skipped, so re-scans are cheap. Re-trigger anytime with the **Rescan library** button (or `POST /api/scan`).

### Music vs podcast detection
A track is classified as `podcast` if its genre or path contains "podcast"; otherwise `music`. You can override by tagging your podcast files with the genre `Podcast` before scanning.

### Listening history
Every time you play something, the React `PlayerContext` fires `POST /api/history/play` with the track id, the actual seconds-listened (computed from `<audio>.currentTime` deltas), and a `completed` flag (true on `ended`). Plays under 5 seconds are ignored.

### Analytics
Pure SQL aggregations over the `plays` table — no extra services needed. Time-of-day heatmap uses SQLite's `strftime` with `localtime`.

### LLM recommendations
`POST /api/recommendations/refresh` builds a compact natural-language profile (top artists/genres last 90 days, recently played, library snapshot) and asks DeepSeek for a JSON list of 8–12 recommendations split between **library** ("you should re-listen to X") and **discover** ("you'd love Y"). Library hits are auto-resolved to `track_id` so you can play them in one click.

`POST /api/recommendations/chat` lets you ask follow-up questions ("what should I put on for focused work?") with the same profile as system context.
